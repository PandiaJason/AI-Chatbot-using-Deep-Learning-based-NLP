# AI-DL-NLP-CHATBOT


**Notice:** This project was conceived before the Gen AI era. I have made the code and documentation completely available under the GPL license. Some of the DL and NLP modules may have been updated in the past 3-4 years, and as a result, the AI Chatbot might not work. However, this project marked the beginning of conceptualizing BERT-like transformers for Gen AI tasks. I am proud to have pioneered this concept and was awarded first place for my B.E. thesis.

## Introduction

It can be challenging for users to obtain specific information directly from search engines, where they often encounter numerous results to manually parse. Obtaining detailed information about a product from an organization can take a considerable amount of time through regular human-to-human conversation or while browsing the organization's website or information booklets. Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are crucial technologies addressing this issue.

## Proposed System

The proposed system aims to provide precise and selective answers from the web, eliminating the need for users to filter or parse through extensive search results. The system is capable of handling open-domain questions, making it predict answers almost every time. Privacy is a significant focus in open-domain search, utilizing DuckDuckGo and Wikipedia APIs for search. It is easily implementable and customizable for specific tasks within a particular application domain. The system is cost-effective and well-suited for use in any browser. Additionally, the system can provide chit-chat answers, reducing traditional knowledge gathering/learning time. Employing Deep Learning (DL)-based NLP technology helps minimize bot misunderstandings, resulting in more specific answers compared to traditional systems.
